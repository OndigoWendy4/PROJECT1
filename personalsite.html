    <br><h1>GET TO KNOW ME</h1>
       <h2>What matters most to you in leadership, in your work, and in life?Â </h2>
          <p>I have always believed that leadership is more about leading yourself first before you can lead others. I always ask myself, if I were someone else, would I follow my lead? What matters most to me is being able to first satisfy my own irreducible minimums of leadership before I can present myself to the rest of the world as a potential leader. Even in my work and life in general, I want to be able to have confidence in myself before I can give others the chance to have confidence in me. In summary, I want to lead by example, to be the change I want to see.</p>

            <h2>What do you value?</h2>
          <P> More than anything, I value individual responsibility. I believe people should take change as an individual responsibility before they can assign that responsibility to someone else.</P>

               <li>respect</li>
              </ul>
         <h2>What are you unwilling to compromise?</h2>
            <P>I refuse to believe that trends cannot be unlearned. Change is inevitable when its pursuit is intentional and growth is certain when people are willing to learn and/or change.</P>

    <li>I am a force to reckon with, and I will speak for the voiceless, stand for those who cannot stand for themselves and lift others up, just as it has been done for me.</li>
